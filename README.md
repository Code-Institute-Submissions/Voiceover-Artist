# Voiceover Website  
Overview 
This Is a website for an aspiring voice over artist in the UK. The goal of this website is to showcase my demos and promote my services. This is important as a voice actor for a few reasons: You as the voice actor are the business therefore you are a brand. A personal website will contribute to defining your brand and reputation e.g who you are and what you have to offer. 
Secondly you won’t always be able to rely on social media because there are limitations. Ideally as a voice actor you want a website in addition to social media presence because with just social media you have variance limitations such as control on the brand image and perception, limited design and layout, and lack of ownership takes more time to find what you need . 
Relating to the client (director, show runners ect) The goal of this website is to give them a sense of professionalism and make life easy enough for the client to see what you are about as a brand,  search for you, view your demos or contact you directly.

#### Existing features
***
Each page features a responsive nav and footer. Within the nav there’s a logo on the left.
Within nav and footer there’s a “contact bar” and within this contact bar is social media links and contact info such as email and phone number. Within the footer there’s a copyright info. 
All the pages feature a header to indicate what page you are on except the home page. The home page has a jumbotron which intuitively indicates “homepage” as this is commonly done on most webpages. 

*	Navigation bar- This is used on each page and allows the user to easily traverse through the website and access each page quickly. 
*	Logo – This is used on each page; this allows the user to recognise and remember the brand. The logo also returns user to the homepage which is a feature the user would be familiar with as this is a staple on most websites.
*	Contact-bar This is used on each page at within the nav on the right side when the screens large and in the middle when the screens in the mid to small range, and within the footer; this allows the user immediate access to contact info when they are finished scrolling down the page without having to recall where to get said contact info. 
*	Header and footer social media icons- This is used on each page to allow the user to access the social media platforms the artist uses. 
*	Footer copyright info- This is used on each page to protect the business from plagiarism. 
*	Homepage- features a jumbotron to call special attention to the voice artist allowing the viewer to know what this website is about when they first enter page.
*	The homepage features snippets of the demos page. There are audio boxes which allows the viewers to listen to quick sample demos so they can get an idea of what the VO can do. 
*	There’s a testimonial section which allows the viewer to see what others have said about the VO. 
*	About-me- This features a different headshot of the VO from the one presented on the homepage, this is to give the viewer a sense of novelty which contributes to a positive emotional response. There’s also a brief bio of the artist which allows viewers to learn some background information on the artist. So, they can get an idea of who they are and connect with them. 
*	Demo – This page just features 3 audio boxes per row x 4. Each row is dedicated to one type of demo reel e.g. one for just characters, and one for just radio presenting; This allows the viewer to listen to a variety of demos to get deeper idea of the VO’s experience; This a step up from the snippet on the homepage. 
*	Blog – This blog page allows viewers another way to discover website and allows the viewer to learn from the thoughts and experiences of the VO This page and the actual article page features an archive to allow the user to traverse through the different months of blog posts. 
* On the blog pages there will be 4 articles vertically stacked with a title and a clickable image which will lead to another page with the blog on it. I made the structure like this to make it visually easy to navigate and process to the viewer. 
*	Contact me- Features a contact form which includes form boxes that asks for the client’s name, email, subject and has a message box for the client to input request or message. This allows the client to communicate directly with the VO and inquire about potential projects.
*	Back to top button – this allows the user to get back to the top of the page by clicking a button that appears, without  having to scroll back to the top manually.
