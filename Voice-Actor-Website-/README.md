# Voiceover Website  
Overview 
This Is a website for an aspiring voice over artist in the UK. The goal of this website is to showcase my demos and promote my services. This is important as a voice actor for a few reasons: You as the voice actor are the business therefore you are a brand. A personal website will contribute to defining your brand and reputation e.g who you are and what you have to offer. 
Secondly you won’t always be able to rely on social media because there are limitations. Ideally as a voice actor you want a website in addition to social media presence because with just social media you have variance limitations such as control on the brand image and perception, limited design and layout, and lack of ownership takes more time to find what you need . 
Relating to the client (director, show runners ect) The goal of this website is to give them a sense of professionalism and make life easy enough for the client to see what you are about as a brand,  search for you, view your demos or contact you directly.
